# Gen 5 Relocation

- You must move the entire lot to a new location.
    - No larger than 40x30
    - Lot must be Off the Grid and remain that way
- You cannot take anything with you from the previous location
    - add dust and holes if you would like to add some charm for later
        - You will be coming back to this house in a later Gen
- To simulate the rags to riches feel that the founder went through you must:
    - either go on a vacation for a week and live off the land that way
    - before building your new location spend a week without shelter. (camping tent is okay)
        - After that week you can use whatever funds you have to create a new location
            - The vibe of the new location should feel desolate / remote
    - After completing the full week you can spin the blessing wheel

The week is important for the sociological portion of the challenge but if you want to skip it, its understandable. It is meant to showcase that when there is a big push for a high control group to be public, a splinter group will go the opposite way and say that they are more worthy of praise.
