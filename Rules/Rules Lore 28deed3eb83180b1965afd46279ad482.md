# Rules

</aside>

There are several rules for this Challenge. The now popularized term ‚ÄúHigh Control Group‚Äù has become synonymous with the word ‚ÄúCult‚Äù. These rules are meant to challenge the player in different aspects of high control groups, following the real trend of high control groups.

- This Challenge is split into three parts
    - Gen 1-3
    - Gen 4-6
    - Gen 7-10
- During the **middle section** you will no longer just be playing in a single household. This challenge references this section as the [Pop-Corn Phase](Pop-Corn%20Phase%2028deed3eb831803ab12fcb29428100f6.md).
- The outside sections you will be playing as your main sim.
    - The main sim should be raised in the ‚Äú[Chosen Household](Chosen%20Household%2028feed3eb831805cbff3dbc18d19f9d2.md)‚Äù
    - Follow the guidelines for each generation if they differ.

There are several specific types of rules that are active throughout the entire challenge. Feel free to increase or decrease their presence in your own game play to adjust the challenge difficulty.

## Rebirth and Death

</aside>

During the course of the playthrough you will be using the rebirth system from Life and Death. 

The character you start with, will be the same character you are playing in Gen 10, **you are living one continuous life** within the cult experience. 

### Life and Death Protocol for Heir

This is the ideal situation.

- Have a [Choosing Ceremony](Choosing%20Ceremony%2028feed3eb83180a6956be37bac5abcd3.md)
- Spin the [Blessing Wheel](https://spinthewheel.app/nYgtXQ4KzF)
- Reset SP

### Dies as the Leader of the Cult

- Trigger a ‚Äú[Week of Penance](Week%20of%20Penance%2028feed3eb8318032a9b9e26af36e48bb.md)‚Äù
    - -2 SP at its completion

### Dies as a member of the cult

### Reincarnation

This is reserved for **everyone but your heir sim**. I also highly recommend recycling characters into side households to further the line instead of playing them through.

You should be keeping all tombstones and urns on the cults lot.

- If they die and have the **rebirth** ability
    - Become reborn as an infant and use the Pop-Corn household spinner to see where they land.
    - +3 SP
        - alternatively you can make them a [Spirit Guide](Spirit%20Guide%2028feed3eb83180658e6be12252b44062.md), that is up to you.
- If they die and **do not** have the rebirth ability they become a [Spirit Guide](Spirit%20Guide%2028feed3eb83180658e6be12252b44062.md)
